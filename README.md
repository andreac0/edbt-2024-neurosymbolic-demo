# EDBT 2024 Demonstration Submission
 This repository includes the KG data generator and the datasets that we use in the paper _``Please, Vadalog, tell me why'': Interactive Explanation of Datalog-based Reasoning_ submitted to EDBT 2024 - Demo Track


## Synthetic KG Generator
The folder ***data_generator*** contains the script to generate an artifical KG of ownership, similar to the real one and of arbitrary dimension. It leverages a list of random companies, available in the csv file ***company.csv*** and generates the KG edges in a new csv file: ***syntethic_kg.csv***.

## Dataset Description

***synthetic_kgs*** are artifially generated graphs that show structural similarities with realistics company network; the number n of nodes in the graph can be chosen by setting the ***number_of_edges*** variable.
